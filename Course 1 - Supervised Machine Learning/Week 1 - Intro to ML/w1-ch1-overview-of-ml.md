## Ch - 1 Overview of Machine Learning

### Welcome to Machine Learning
> Machine learning is the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed ~ *Andrew Ng*

Machine learning is used to find and learn patterns from the data and predict outcomes. It is sub-field of **Artificial Intelligence**(AI).

Example:
- Ranking webpages on Search engine (Google)
- Image recognition (insta, snapchat)
- Recommendation system (YT, Netflix)
- Detecting spam emails
- Weather Forecasting
- House price prediction
- etc...


### Applications of Machine Learning
Machine Learning can be use in many industries like agriculture, health-care, e-commerce etc...

**Artificial General Intelligence**(AGI):
> Looking even further into the future, many people, including me, are excited about the AI dream of someday building machines as intelligent as you or me. This is sometimes called Artificial General Intelligence or AGI. ~ *Andrew Ng*

> Artificial general Intelligence is the ability of an intelligent agent to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. ~ [*Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#:~:text=Artificial%20general%20intelligence%20(AGI)%20is%20the%20ability%20of%20an%20intelligent%20agent%20to%20understand%20or%20learn%20any%20intellectual%20task%20that%20a%20human%20being%20can.)

AGI is making machines intelligent as humans are.
